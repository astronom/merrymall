    The .htaccess file is very usefull: it's flexible, it works everywhere and the modifications are processed instantaneously.
</p>
<p>
    But the drawback is that the rules written in it can't be cached by apache, the server has to scan the file for every single request.
</p>
<p>
    If you move the .htaccess rules to your virtual host configuration file, the rules will be cached and apache performance will improve.
</p>
<p>
    Unfortunately, you can't access to the apache configuration files on shared hosts, that's why symfony uses the .htaccess file by default.
    <br>
    <strong>So sorry, this tip only works for dedicated server users.</strong>
</p>
<h3>Open your virtual host configuration file</h3>
<p>
    Most often, you'll find the virtual host configurations in the bottom of the 
    <code>
        httpd.conf
    </code>, but sometimes, they are moved in some 
    <code>
        vhosts.conf
    </code>
    file.
</p>
<p>
    Your virtual host should look like to something like this:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
  ServerName my-symfony-project.com
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  DocumentRoot "/path-to-your-sf-project/web"
  &lt;Directory "/path-to-your-sf-project/web"&gt;
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
  Alias /sf /path-to-your-sf-project/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf/
  &lt;Directory "/path-to-your-sf-project/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf/"&gt;
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
    You need to add your rules to 
    <code>
        &lt;Directory "/path-to-your-sf-project/web"&gt;
    </code>
    :
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Directory "/path-to-your-sf-project/web"&gt;
  AllowOverride None
  Allow from All
  Options FollowSymLinks ExecCGI

  RewriteEngine On

  # uncomment the following line, if you are having trouble
  # getting no_script_name to work
  #RewriteBase /

  # we skip all files with .something
  #RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \..+$
  #RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !\.html$
  #RewriteRule .* - [L]

  # we check if the .html version is here (caching)
  RewriteRule ^$ index.html [QSA]
  RewriteRule ^([^.]+)$ $1.html [QSA]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f

  # no, so we redirect to our front web controller
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3>Remove the 
    <code>
        my_project/web/.htaccess
    </code>
    file
</h3>
<p>
    Unless you added extra rules in it, the file is now useless.
</p>
<h3>Test the modifications and restart Apache</h3>
<p>
    Apache provides the 
    <code>
        configtest
    </code>
    tool to check that apache configuration files are ok.
</p>
<p>
    On many linux servers, you can access to apache commands by 
    <code>
        /etc/init.d/apachectl makeMeSandwich
    </code>.
    <br>
    Rights errors just need the 
    <code>
        sudo
    </code>
    prefix to be fixed: 
    <code>
        sudo /etc/init.d/apachectl makeMeSandwich
    </code>
</p>
<pre><code>/etc/init.d/apachectl apachectl configtest
</code></pre>
<p>
    If there's no error:
</p>
<pre><code>/etc/init.d/apachectl apachectl restart
</code></pre>
<h3>Document this in a README file</h3>
<p>
    Your project really should have at least one README file where this kind of modifications are reported.
