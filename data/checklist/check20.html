    When it comes to security, the very first rule is that all data sent  by users should be validated before being stored on the server.
</p>
<p>
    Experience shows that some developers give poor, little or no attention at all to validating file uploads.
</p>
<p>
    This is mostly due to laziness. However, sometimes the purpose is to build a more flexible form. Example: a CV upload field that accepts any file extension.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>This is a huge security mistake.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Why? Because these files by default are stored in the 
    <code>
        uploads
    </code>
    directory which is publicly accessible.
</p>
<p>
    If one of your users succeeds in uploading a php file, such as 
    <code>
        attack.php
    </code>
    through one of your forms, then he will be able to run the script just by using the 
    <code>
        http//your-sf-project.com/uploads/attack.php
    </code>
    uri.
</p>
<p>
    If the aforementioned php file contained malicious code then the hacker could get access to your database settings, user details,  delete data etc.
</p>
<h3>First step: check all of your file upload fields</h3>
<p>
    It is absolutely critical that uploaded files are validated.
</p>
<p>
    Read again the <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/forms/1_4/en/B-Validators#chapter_b_sub_sfvalidatorfile">file validator documentation</a>. Do all of your validators have customised 
    <code>
        mime_types
    </code>
    or a 
    <code>
        mime_categories
    </code>
    option ? 
    You should also prevent your forms from accepting the 
    <code>
        .htaccess
    </code>
    mime  type.
</p>
<h3>Second step: disable php execution in the "uploads" directory</h3>
<p>
    If you have access to the 
    <code>
        httpd.conf
    </code>
    file, add the following rule to your virtualhost:
</p>
<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;

   ...
   ...
   &lt;Directory "/path/to/my/sfProject/web/uploads"&gt;
     php_flag engine off
   &lt;/Directory&gt;
 &lt;/VirtualHost &gt;
</code></pre>
<p>
    If you donâ€™t have access to the 
    <code>
        httpd.conf
    </code>
    of your host, add a new 
    <code>
        .htaccess
    </code>
    file in your 
    <code>
        /path/to/my/sfProject/web/uploads
    </code>
    directory:
</p>
<pre><code>php_flag engine off
</code></pre>
<h3>Third step: Avoid to use the 
    <code>
        uploads
    </code>
    directory when you can
</h3>
<p>
    Some uploaded files - like user avatars - need to be publicly accessible and are displayed very often by the server, the 
    <code>
        uploads
    </code>
    directory is the right place for them.
</p>
<p>
    But many other user files are private or rarely displayed. All these files could be stored in the 
    <code>
        data
    </code>
    directory (<a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/book/1_2/02-Exploring-Symfony-s-Code#chapter_02_sub_file_tree_structure">documentation</a>).
</p>
<p>
    1/ Create a 
    <code>
        files
    </code>
    sub directory: 
    <code>
        mkdir /path/to/my/sfProject/data/files
    </code>
</p>
<p>
    2/ Change the 
    <code>
        path
    </code>
    option in your forms:
</p>
<pre><code>$this-&gt;validatorSchema['driver_licence_pic'] = new sfValidatorFile(array(
  'mime_types' =&gt; 'web_images',
  'path'       =&gt; sfConfig::get('sf_data_dir').'/files/driver_licence',
));
</code></pre>
<p>
    3/ And add a dedicated route to the file.
</p>
